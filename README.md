# quarkus-langchain4j-examples

This project uses [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.
This Project also uses [Langchain4j](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/) but not the quarkus-extension because of limitations.

This project contains 3 endpoints, one being a simple interaction with a LLM, one with a Easy-RAG implementation and one with a Naive-RAG

The datasets used for the RAG can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/docugami/KG-RAG-datasets)

This was testd running llama3 locally, to execute with Ollama follow the instructions [here](https://ollama.com/)
